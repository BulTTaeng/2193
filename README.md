## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/2193/blob/main/2193_pro.JPG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we cannot put 1 after the binaray number end with 1, I thought there should be some pattern.

I write down the possible cases.

1. 1

2. 10

3. 101
   
   100
   
4. 1010
   1001
   1000
   
After these sequence I found that adding 01 after (i-2) and add 0 after (i-1) will make all possible cases for (i).


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
Thank you for visiting this github!
